# Best-fit parameterization of a bidimensional Dark-Energy Model


A simple code that makes a best-fit estimation of parameters of a bidimensional model of dark energy described by a certain equation of state. It uses the MCMC method and its based on the emcee Python module (see e.g. https://emcee.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/line/)

If you have any inquiries about the code or the background theory, please read the accompanying paper "Statistical Analysis of a Bidimensional Dark Energy Parametrization", or email me: aldojavier@ciencias.unam.mx

The code is based on Python 3.7.6.
